ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm [Your Legal Name], though most people know me as Roxanna or Roxy (she/her).

Currently thriving in Network Operations, I'm making the leap to Cyber Security, especially PenTesting and Red Teaming. Behind my legal name, you'll find someone who values inclusion and diversityâ€”I use she/her pronouns and live authentically, so you'll see both my legal and chosen names across different platforms and applications.

I'm passionate about Python, AWS, Azure, and backend dev, with active learning in MySQL, full-stack engineering, Unity, and Blender. I'm always up for new challenges, especially where digital safety, teamwork, and creativity matter.

Looking to connect or collaborate on CyberSec, game dev, AI, or data analytics? Reach out by email, GitHub, or LinkedIn. Let's make something meaningful together!
