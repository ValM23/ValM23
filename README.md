Hey, I'm Roxanna Valdez (she/her)—recruiters, brace for the plot twist: legal docs still scream Matthew Thomas Valdez thanks to ancient systems lagging behind life. 🌈🐧🏳️‍⚧️

Day job: Drowning in NOC chaos, wrangling MSPs/ISPs on marathon calls, dispatching fixes, and burying ticket tsunamis. Spoiler: It's zero glamour—think bomb squad for pissed users, crap infrastructure, and schooling execs that we can't bully the web into behaving. Survived a spite-fueled overnight shift? Fist bump, comrade. 🛡️📞💥 No capes here, just hold-button mastery.

Off-duty: PenTesting, Red Teaming, CTFs, chasing CPTS on Hack The Box. Linux loyalist—Endeavour OS + Hyprland, 'cause vanilla desktops are for quitters; I'd rather tinker configs till dawn. Powered by Monster Energy and soda regrets. ☕🖥️😴

Skills: Ruby, Python, C++, Rust (trans + Rust? Cosmic joke). 🤓🏳️‍⚧️ AWS, Docker, 2AM VMs? Let's vibe. Windows? Tolerated. Endeavour saves my sanity.
Dream: Red Team/Threat Hunt/Malware Analyst—zero Karens mistaking routers for sorcery. Red-state life? Compartmentalize or perish. 🌶️🦸‍♀️

Recruiters: Read this? You're elite. Don't ghost; let's plot real gigs. 🦄📩
Ping me: Email, GitHub, LinkedIn, or a sassy PR to flex your attention span. 🚀
